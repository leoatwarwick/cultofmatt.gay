Because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of non-functional languages. I solve practical problems, for instance: how am I going to solve this wacky sudoku puzzle that I came up with as a coursework? The answer, use a Haskell, and if that don't work... Use more Haskell.

Personally I give no fucks about wah it was fun for a bit kinda just moved on and no point creating a fuss really, just the response to it was just really fucking stupid imo and indicative of how boring and sort of bureaucratic the current exec wanna behave.

I am not opposed to adding the emote, at all, but I wasn’t happy with the spam that happened last night. Yes some of that was a result of my poor communication and I apologise for that.

"Trolling my whole class with Among Us

So today in school, my English teacher was having us do presentation in front of our class. For my presentation, I decided to troll my entire class by making my entire slideshow about the popular game, Among Us. I started off the presentation by showing the class the picture of the Among Us imposter wearing sneakers (it's a meme on google if you want to search for it). For some reason, no one laughed at the meme. My teacher told me ""this isn't what your presentation is supposed to be about."" I responded by yelling ""THE TEACHER IS SUS I SAW HER VENT"" and then naruto running around the room. Again, no one even giggled. I assume it's because it was forst bell and everyone was tired. My teacher said ""Please sit down."" But I wasn't about to give up. I made a last ditch effort to make everyone laugh. I started to beatbox the Among Us theme song trap remix. I was beatboxing it so well (i had practiced it at home), i was certain that everyone would burst out in laughter. Unfortunately, not a single person laughed. Everyone was staring at me, so I said ""You guys are all sussy, I'm gonna eject you"".

Long story short, I ended up getting a bad grade on my presentation and I got a detention. However, it was worth it because I totally got to troll my entire class.",<:kekw:775423225400262656>

"I just downvoted your comment.
FAQ
What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

    Rudeness towards other Redditors,
    Spreading incorrect information,
    Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.
    Not marking your edits with an EDIT: tag

Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",<:kekw:775423225400262656>

"I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called ""Linux"", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called ""Linux"" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.",<:mattlaugh:763749134288027659>
